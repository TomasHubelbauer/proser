# Proser

A VS Code extension for writing MarkDown prose in a much neater way.

## To-Do

### Implement this extension idea

Create an extension which will take over MD files and open a custom editor,
which will either be the MarkDown preview VS Code viewer but made editable, or a
custom editor which looks very much like it, but capable of editing.

This will give the user to WYSIWYG edit MarkDown but view it rendered so that
noisy parts such as URLs don't break the flow. It will also make checkboxes
easily clickable and stuff.
